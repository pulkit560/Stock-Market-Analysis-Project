# Stock Market Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing stock market trends and predicting stock prices using regression techniques. By leveraging historical stock data, we aim to identify key factors influencing stock performance and provide actionable insights.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) or similar platforms.
- **Features**:
  - Date
  - Open, High, Low, Close prices
  - Volume of trade
  - Moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day)

## Objectives
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand historical stock performance.
2. Build a regression model to predict stock prices based on historical data.
3. Visualize trends and insights for better understanding.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Implementation
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Fetched historical stock data for a specific company or index (e.g., S&P 500).
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Generated technical indicators like moving averages and RSI.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed trends, correlations, and seasonality.
4. **Model Building**:
   - Used linear regression to predict stock closing prices.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².
5. **Visualization**:
   - Plotted historical trends, predictions, and residuals.

## Results
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an R² score of 0.82.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Stock prices show a strong correlation with moving averages.
  - Seasonal patterns were observed in trading volumes.
