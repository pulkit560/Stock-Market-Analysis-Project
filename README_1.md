# Simple Trading Strategy Using Moving Averages

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple trading strategy using moving averages. The strategy involves analyzing short-term and long-term moving averages to generate buy and sell signals for trading. This approach is commonly used in financial markets to identify potential trends and reversals.

---

## Objectives
1. To implement a trading strategy based on moving averages.
2. To evaluate the strategy's performance using metrics such as cumulative returns and visualization of signals.
3. To provide insights into its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

---

## Data
The project uses historical stock price data (e.g., daily open, close, high, and low prices) to calculate moving averages and generate trading signals.

---

## Methodology
### 1. Preprocessing
- Load historical stock price data.
- Handle missing values and clean the dataset.

### 2. Moving Averages
- **Short-Term Moving Average**: Represents a faster-moving trend.
- **Long-Term Moving Average**: Represents a slower-moving trend.
  
The trading signals are generated based on the crossover of these moving averages:
- **Buy Signal**: When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average.
- **Sell Signal**: When the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

### 3. Performance Metrics
- **Cumulative Returns**: Calculate returns from the trading strategy over the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Plot stock prices with moving averages and signals.

---

## Implementation
### 1. Generate Moving Averages
- Compute short-term and long-term moving averages from the stock price data.

### 2. Create Trading Signals
- Use crossover logic to determine buy and sell signals.

### 3. Evaluate Strategy
- Compare the cumulative returns of the strategy against a simple "buy and hold" strategy.

### 4. Plot Results
- Visualize stock prices, moving averages, and trading signals.

## Prerequisites
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
    
---

## How to Run
1. Load the script or notebook in your Python environment.
2. Provide the historical stock price data in the required format.
3. Execute the code to compute signals and evaluate performance.

---

## Results
The strategy identifies potential buy and sell opportunities based on moving average crossovers. It provides insights into whether the strategy outperforms a "buy and hold" approach over the same period.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of moving averages as a simple yet effective tool for trading strategies. However, the performance of this strategy can vary depending on market conditions, stock volatility, and parameter optimization for moving average windows.
