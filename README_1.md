Overview

This project demonstrates a systematic approach to analyzing stock market data using statistical methods and trading strategies. Key concepts include:

Confidence Interval Calculation

Hypothesis Testing for Stock Returns

Implementing a Moving Average (MA) Crossover Strategy

Risk Analysis with Value at Risk (VaR)

Features

1. Confidence Interval

Calculates the 90% confidence interval for the log returns of a stock, providing insights into the range of expected returns.

2. Hypothesis Testing

Performs a statistical hypothesis test to determine whether the average log return is significantly different from zero.

3. Moving Average Crossover Strategy

Implements a simple trading strategy based on the crossover of 10-day and 50-day moving averages. Calculates cumulative wealth generated by the strategy.

4. Value at Risk (VaR)

Quantifies potential losses with a 95% confidence level, offering insights into the risk associated with stock price movements.
