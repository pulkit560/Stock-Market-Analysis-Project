SPY Trading Strategy Using Multiple Linear Regression
Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a trading strategy for SPY (an ETF tracking the S&P 500 index) using multiple linear regression. The model leverages historical data from various stock indices to predict SPY price movements, enabling a signal-based trading strategy.

Key Objectives
Build a predictive model to estimate SPY price changes based on other stock indices' data.
Evaluate the model's performance using both statistical and practical metrics.
Compare the profitability of a signal-based strategy with a traditional "buy-and-hold" approach.

Data Sources
The project uses historical data from the following stock markets:

ALLOrdinary (AORD)
Nikkei 225 (Japan)
Hang Seng Index (HSI)
DAX Index (Germany)
CAC40 (France)
S&P 500 (SP500)
